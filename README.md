# Project Description

Building test-type react app - just started learning this on Monday and want to practice steps to build "muscle memory"

Key steps are:

1. ```npx create-react-app name-of-app```
2. empty README.md file and add own description
3. 'cd' into the name-of-app and run ```npm start```
4. Create a template file and then copy/past it to create new components (i.e. images, buttons, headers, etc)
5. Don't forget to import the components into the App.js as ```import Body from '././Body/Body';```
6. Use {JSON.Stringify(something)} to see what objects, arrays, strings look like on the DOM
7. SUPER IMPORTANT!! If you want to use an img, make sure to put it in Public/img.
8. Nice to use ternary operator instead of if/else since it is more conside.
